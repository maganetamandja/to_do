help me understand this primal  perceptron algorithm: 

Given a linearly separable training set S and learning rate N element of positive Reals

W0 <- 0; b0 <- 0; k <- 0

R <-max 1<=i<=l |X_i|

repeat 
    for i==1 to l
        if yi([W_k*X_i] + b_k)<=0 then
            W_k+1 <- W_k + N*y_i*X_i
            b_k+1 <- b_k + N*y_i*R^2
            k<-k+1
        end if
    end for
until no mistakes made within the for loop
return (wk, bk) where k is the number of mistakes.
